Wyrd Glamorgan is a project based in the historic Welsh county of Glamorganshire. With a primary focus on photography as a medium, Wyrd Glamorgan will feature the rich, colourful and admittedly rather bizzare history of Glamorgan.
Through explorations of local folklore, ghost stories, hauntology, urban wyrd and the otherwise uncanny, the beauty of this weird place will become apparent.
 
Currrently, this section (and this website generally) is work-in-progress.
